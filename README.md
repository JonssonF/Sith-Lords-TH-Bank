 # **TH-Bank - A school group-project.**

< Console Application >
< C# .NET v.8. >


<br>**Code description**<br/>

This application is a mock-up of a banking app. The basic structure is as follows:
Menu objects -> User interface code
DataHandler objects -> Saves and loads information from file in real time
Factory objects -> Handles creation of new objects
Facade objects -> Contains logic that uses several other objects (like making a transaction between accounts)

There are five main abstract classes that objects in the program inherit from:

User objects - Customers, admins<br>
Account objects - Salary account, Savings account<br>
Loan objects - Car loan, House loan<br>
Menu objects - Customer menu, Admin menu<br>
Currency objects - SEK, EUR, USD<br>

There are also two important objects that currently do not inherit from an abstract class,
although this could be expanded on in the future:

Transaction objects<br>
Factory objects<br>

The DataHandler objects inherit from a structure of Interfaces, that varies in functionality
to make sure DataHandler objects only inherit methods they can make use of:

IObjectHandler - The "main" interface that all DataHandlers inherit from.<br>
IMyDataHandler (inherits from IObjectHandler) - Mostly used by Customer objects to handle data that they own.<br>
IAggregateDataHandler (inherits from IObjectHandler) - Mostly used by Admin objects to handle non-user-specific data.<br>

There are also two DataHandlers that differ a bit from the others:

ExchangeDataHandler handles both currencies and exchange rates (this could probably be split up in two in the future).<<br>
SystemDataHandler handles system-specific data (for example making sure all new user ID:s are unique).<br>

Finally there are a couple of other classes that handle information:

TransactionSender - corralls transactions and makes sure they are excecuted at the correct time<br>
ExchangeCurrency - contains methods for quickly exchanging money and viewing current exchange rates<br>
FilePaths - static class that contains paths for save files and nothing else<br>
Format - static class that contains methods for number input safety, to be used throughout the program<br>

The facade objects are not implemented yet, but there is a UserFacade class that contains methods for
interacting with user objects.
